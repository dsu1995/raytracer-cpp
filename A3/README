Changes made to data strucutures:

JointNode was changed to contain the current x/y angle, in addition to the max, min, and init angles.
Member functions rotateX() and rotateY() were added to manipulate the current angle.
Member function reset() was added to reset the current angle back to the init angle.

The torso is the first GeometryNode under the root.

The torso has children: neck, tail, both upper arms, both upper legs.

The neck connects to the head, which has eyes, fins, and a tongue wrapped around the head.

The upper arm connects to the lower arm via the elbow. The lower arm connects to the hand and fingers.

The upper leg connects to the lower leg via the knee. The lower leg connects to the foot and toes.
